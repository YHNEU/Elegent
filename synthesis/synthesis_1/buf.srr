 Note: 'No paths' indicates there are no paths in the design for that pair of clock edges.
       'Diff grp' indicates that paths exist but the starting clock and ending clock are in different clock groups.

Total path delay (propagation time + setup) of 11.476 is 7.416(64.6%) logic and 4.060(35.4%) route.
Path delay compensated for clock skew. Clock skew is added to clock-to-out value, and is subtracted from setup time value

Total path delay (propagation time + setup) of 11.039 is 7.357(66.6%) logic and 3.683(33.4%) route.
Path delay compensated for clock skew. Clock skew is added to clock-to-out value, and is subtracted from setup time value

Total path delay (propagation time + setup) of 15.650 is 6.091(38.9%) logic and 9.559(61.1%) route.
Path delay compensated for clock skew. Clock skew is added to clock-to-out value, and is subtracted from setup time value

Total path delay (propagation time + setup) of 15.415 is 7.454(48.4%) logic and 7.962(51.6%) route.
Path delay compensated for clock skew. Clock skew is added to clock-to-out value, and is subtracted from setup time value

Total path delay (propagation time + setup) of 7.132 is 2.263(31.7%) logic and 4.870(68.3%) route.
Path delay compensated for clock skew. Clock skew is added to clock-to-out value, and is subtracted from setup time value
