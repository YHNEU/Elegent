Instrumentor
*** Integrated Instrumentor ***
Added instrumentation 'synthesis' to the project
"design_flow" is unrecognized option for current device
Added instrumentation 'synthesis_1' to the project
"design_flow" is unrecognized option for current device
Current design is buf
Loading instrumentation 'synthesis_1'
Setting IICE sampler (set IICE clock) to '/sys_clk' for IICE named 'IICE' (previous value: '')

Setting IICE sampler (sampledepth) to 8 for IICE named 'IICE'(previous value: 128)
Instrumenting design `buf' in directory C:\Users\YH\Desktop\RS422\RS4221106 - good\synthesis\synthesis_1
The target device family is 'ProASIC3' (and considered a ProAsic3-based family; hence we do care about UJTAG / UJTAG_WRAPPER instances).
The design does not contain a UJTAG_WRAPPER instance.
OK, the design does not contain a UJTAG instance.
